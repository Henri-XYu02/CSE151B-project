You need to manually download train.csv and other files

Run Feature Engineering.ipynb to save train_features.pt and train_labels.pt

Currently I used one-hot encoding for TAXI_ID, which creates about 450 columns and requires too much memory. I may update feature engineering code to produce training sets that take less memory & easier to train
